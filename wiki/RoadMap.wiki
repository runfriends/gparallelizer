===0.8===

Planned release: June 2009

  * Data-flow concurrency
  * Fast send (without the reply management overhead)
  * Send and Wait (synchronous send)
  * Ability to join an actor and so wait for its termination
  * Make all actor threads daemon by default.
  * Prepare a representative benchmark to measure future performance improvements
  * Add experimental support for Fork/Join thread pool to run actors
  * Make thread-bound actors use a resizable thread pool
  * DynamicDispatchActor to allow for an alternative message handling syntax - dynamic method dispatch to multiple onMessage() methods
  * Added a Reactor implementation - a special purpose actor, which after receiving a message runs its body with the message as a parameter and the result of the code is send in reply.
