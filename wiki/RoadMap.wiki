== Release plan ==

Since we're exploring quite an unknown territory here and still live in the 0.x era we will make our release cycle pretty short (estimated about max 2 months each), preferably a minor release after each completed major addition.
We'll only make bugfix releases in case there's a considerable number of bugs that need to get fixed. This policy is likely to change once we reach the 1.0 era.
