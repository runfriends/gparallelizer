= Proposals =

  # *GParallel* - limit brand change
  # *Gras (Grass)* - "Groovy ASynchronously" or "Groovy Actors and Synchonization"
  # *Tractor* - a play on words with Actor in it
  # *Attractor*
  # *Atractor*
  # *GRAND* (GRoovy Actor N Dataflow)
  # *GRACE* (Groovy Actor Concurrency Executor?)
  # *Grapa*
  # *gp* (groovy parallelism - pronounced jeep)
  # *gpars* (as above - pronounced jeepers)
  # *gconch* (groovy concurrency handling - similar to jconch)
  # *gcamp* (groovy concurrency, actors, multi-threading, parallelism) 
  # *Gektor* - sounds like Hector, Troy war hero, also is pronounced like it has "actor" in it
  # *GRIP* - GRoovy Intuitive Parallelism (or just GRoovy In Parallel)
  # *GRANDPAR* - as before for GRAND but with PARallelism added
  # *GRILLA* - (GRoovy In paraLLel with Actors, allows PILLA to be the Python version for Russel)

= General guidelines =

Below you can find the list of preferences that the new name should take into consideration:

  * The name should not emphasize one particular model of parallelism (there are more coming ;) )
  * it should be short
  * it should be easy to remember
  * it may be read as an acronym
  * it may best not be a valid english word, but sound like one
  * it should have a conotation to the "many things at once"
