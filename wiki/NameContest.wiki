= General guidelines =

Below you can find the list of preferences that the new name should take into consideration:

  * The name should not emphasize one particular model of parallelism (there are more coming ;) )
  * it should be short
  * it should be easy to remember
  * it may be read as an acronym
  * it may best not be a valid english word, but sound like one
  * it should have a conotation to the "many things at once"
