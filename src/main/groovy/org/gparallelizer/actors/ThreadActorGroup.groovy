/**
 * Provides logical grouping for actors. Each group holds a thread pool, which will provide threads for all
 * actors created in that group. Actors created through the ActorGroup.actor*() methods will automatically belong
 * to the group through which they were created.
 * <pre>
 *
 * def group = new ThreadActorGroup()
 *
 * def actor = group.actor {
 *     receive {message ->
 *         println message
 *     }
 * }.start()
 *
 * actor.send 'Hi!'
 * ...
 * actor.stop()
 * </pre>
 *
 * Otherwise, if constructing Actors directly through their constructors, the CommonActorImpl.actorGroup property,
 * which defaults to the Actors.defaultActorGroup, can be set before the actor is started.
 *
 * <pre>
 * def group = new ThreadActorGroup(false)
 *
 * def actor = new MyActor()
 * actor.actorGroup = group
 * actor.start()
 *
 * </pre>
 *
 * ThreadActorGroups use pools of daemon threads.
