The gpars project is looking for a logo. If you have an idea on how a **gpars** logo should look like, please send your proposal to our [Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/gparallelizer?pli=1). We'll consider all submitted proposals carefully and choose the logo that best resonates with our perception of the project and its domain.
We don't want to restrict your creativity in any way, the sky is the limit here.
