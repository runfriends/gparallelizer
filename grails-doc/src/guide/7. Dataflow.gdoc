Functional tests involve testing the actual running application and are often harder to automate. Grails does not ship with any functional testing support out of the box, but has support for "Canoo WebTest":http://webtest.canoo.com/ via a plug-in.

To get started install Web Test with the following commands:

{code:java}
grails install-plugin webtest

{code}

Then refer to the [reference on the wiki|http://grails.org/Functional+Testing] which explains how to go about using Web Test and Grails.
