		Throughout the documentation so far the convention used for URLs has been the default of <code>/controller/action/id</code>. However, this convention is not hard wired into Grails and is in fact controlled by a URL Mappings class located at <code>grails-app/conf/UrlMappings.groovy</code>.<p class="paragraph"/>The <code>UrlMappings</code> class contains a single property called <code>mappings</code> that has been assigned a block of code:<p class="paragraph"/><div class="code"><pre>class UrlMappings &#123;
    <span class="java&#45;keyword">static</span> mappings = &#123;
    &#125;
