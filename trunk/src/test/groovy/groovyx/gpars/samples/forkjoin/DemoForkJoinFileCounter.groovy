/**
 Fork/Join operations can be safely run with small number of threads thanks to using the TaskBarrier class to synchronize the threads.
 Although the algorithm creates as many tasks as there are subdirectories and tasks wait for the subdirectory tasks to complete,
 as few as one thread is enough to keep the computation going.
