/**
 * Represents a thread-safe single-assignment, multi-read variable.
 * Each instance of DataFlowVariable can be read repeatedly any time using the 'val' property and assigned once
 * in its lifetime using the '<<' operator. Reads preceding assignment will be blocked until the value
 * is assigned.
 * For actors and Dataflow Operators the asynchronous non-blocking variants of the getValAsync() methods can be used.
 * They register the request to read a value and will send a message to the actor or operator once the value is available.
