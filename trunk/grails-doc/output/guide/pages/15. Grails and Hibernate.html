		If <a href="../guide/single.html#5. Object Relational Mapping (GORM)" class="guide">GORM (Grails Object Relational Mapping)</a> is not flexible enough for your liking you can alternatively map your domain class using Hibernate. To do this create a <code>hibernate.cfg.xml</code> file in the <code>grails-app/conf/hibernate</code> directory of your project and the corresponding HBM mapping xml files for your domain classes.<p class="paragraph"/><blockquote class="note">
For more info on how to do this read the <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/" target="blank">documentation on mapping</a> on the Hibernate Website
</blockquote><p class="paragraph"/>This will allow you to map Grails domain classes onto a wider range of legacy systems and be more flexible in the creation of your database schema.<p class="paragraph"/>Grails also allows you to write your domain model in Java or re-use an existing domain model that has been mapped using Hibernate. All you have to do is place the necessary <code>hibernate.cfg.xml</code> file and corresponding mappings files in the <code>grails-app/conf/hibernate</code> directory.<p class="paragraph"/>Additionally, the good news is you will still be able to call all of the dynamic persistent and query methods allowed in <a href="../guide/single.html#5. Object Relational Mapping (GORM)" class="guide">GORM</a>!
