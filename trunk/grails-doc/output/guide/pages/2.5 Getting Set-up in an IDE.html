		<h4>IntelliJ IDEA</h4><p class="paragraph"/>The most mature Groovy &#38; Grails IDE is <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea" target="blank">IntelliJ IDEA 7.0</a> and the <a href="http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/GRVY/Groovy+Home" target="blank">JetGroovy</a> plug-in. Refer to the section on <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/groovy_grails.html" target="blank">Groovy and Grails</a> support on the JetBrains website for a feature overview.<p class="paragraph"/><h4>NetBeans </h4><p class="paragraph"/>A good Open Source alternative is Sun's NetBeans, which provides a Groovy/Grails plugin that automatically recognizes Grails projects and provides the ability to run Grails applications in the IDE, code completion and integration with Sun's Glassfish server. For an overview of features see the <a href="http://www.grails.org/NetBeans+Integration" target="blank">NetBeans Integration</a> guide on the Grails website which was written by the NetBeans team.<p class="paragraph"/><h4>Eclipse</h4><p class="paragraph"/>For <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/" target="blank">Eclipse</a> there is also the <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/Eclipse+Plugin" target="blank">Groovy Eclipse Plugin</a> that offers syntax highlighting, code completion and so on.<p class="paragraph"/><blockquote class="note">
There are some quirks with the Groovy Eclipse plug-in which are <a href="http://grails.org/Eclipse+IDE+Integration" target="blank">covered in detail</a> on the Grails wiki.
</blockquote><p class="paragraph"/>Grails automatically creates Eclipse <code>.project</code> and <code>.classpath</code> files for you, so to import a Grails project just right-click in the "Package Explorer" and select "Import" then "Existing project into Workspace" and "Browse" to the location of your project.<p class="paragraph"/>Then immediately click "Ok" followed by "Finish" and your project will be set-up.<p class="paragraph"/>Grails will also automatically set-up an appropriate Eclipse "Run Configuration", that can be accessed from the "Run" menu in Eclipse.<p class="paragraph"/><h4>TextMate</h4><p class="paragraph"/>Since Grails' focus is on simplicity it is often possible to utilize more simple editors and <a href="http://macromates.com/" target="blank">TextMate</a> on the Mac has an excellent Groovy/Grails bundle available from the <a href="http://wiki.macromates.com/Main/SubversionCheckout" target="blank">Texmate bundles SVN</a>.
