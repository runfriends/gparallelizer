		Grails applications are deployed as Web Application Archives (WAR files), and Grails includes the <a href="../ref/Command Line/war.html" class="commandLine">war</a> command for performing this task:<p class="paragraph"/><div class="code"><pre>grails war</pre></div><p class="paragraph"/>This will produce a WAR file in the root of your project which can then be deployed as per your containers instructions.<p class="paragraph"/><blockquote class="warning">
NEVER deploy Grails using the <a href="../ref/Command Line/run-app.html" class="commandLine">run-app</a> command as this command sets Grails up for auto-reloading at runtime which has a severe performance and scalability implication
</blockquote><p class="paragraph"/>When deploying Grails you should always run your containers JVM with the <code>-server</code> option and with sufficient memory allocation. A good set of VM flags would be:<p class="paragraph"/><div class="code"><pre>&#45;server &#45;Xmx512M</pre></div>
