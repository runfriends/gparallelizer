&#125;</pre></div><p class="paragraph"/><h2>Description</h2><p class="paragraph"/>Usage: <code>batchSize(integer)</code><p class="paragraph"/>Given a lazy association where an <code>Author</code> has many <code>Books</code>, GORM will perform one query to get a hold of the <code>Author</code> and then an additional query for each associated <code>Book</code>. This is what is known as the N+1 problem and can often be worked around by using a join query. However, joins can be expensive.<p class="paragraph"/>Batch fetching is an optimization of lazy loading so that if, for example, you set a <code>batchSize</code> of 10 and you have an <code>Author</code> that has written 30 books, instead of 31 queries you get 4 (1 to fetch the <code>Author</code> and then three batches of 10):<p class="paragraph"/><div class="code"><pre><span class="java&#45;keyword">static</span> mapping = &#123;
	batchSize 10
&#125;</pre></div><p class="paragraph"/>You can also configure <code>batchSize</code> on a per association basis:<p class="paragraph"/><div class="code"><pre>class Author &#123;
	<span class="java&#45;keyword">static</span> hasMany = &#91;books:Book&#93;
	<span class="java&#45;keyword">static</span> mapping = &#123;
		books batchSize: 10
