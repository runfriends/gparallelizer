&#125;</pre></div><p class="paragraph"/><h2>Description</h2><p class="paragraph"/>Usage: <code>dynamicInsert(boolean)</code><p class="paragraph"/>By default Hibernate will build all queries at start-up time and cache them, which represents a significant performance gain as queries don't have to be dynamically generated at runtime. However, there are certain circumstances where dynamic queries are useful.<p class="paragraph"/>For example if you were using custom <code>UserType</code> to hash passwords, every time an UPDATE occurred, the password would get re-hashed. The <code>dynamicInsert</code> method allows you to turn of the dynamic creation of queries that uses only the properties that are needed to perform the insert.
